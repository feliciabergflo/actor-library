# About the project

Its an actor library website that is built using the react framework and uses [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). The website shows the user the most popular actors who are constantly updates with the most popular actors and when the user click on one of these actors so shos up a modal with actor informatin. The website contains a search function that takes the user on to the sought-after actor with a picture of the actor, biography and the films for which he is known. Users have the option after reading about the specific wanted actor to save it in the favorites page.

# Comparison between frameworks

We chose to use React as a JS-framework in this project. The main reason were the fact that multiple sources claim that React is the most frequently used framework with a big community of users. Out of all framworks, there are most questions posted on Stack Overflow regarding React, which means that there are more guides and a higher chance of finding solutions to any problems we may encounter. Both of us had also worked with React in previous projects, and felt that we hade some experience to build on. We agreed that we would rather deepen our knowledge of React than learn how to work with a whole new framework. 

The two most used JavaScript frameworks after React are Vue and Angular among other. The three of them were released moderately close together, but Angular being the oldest (released 2010) and Vue being the newest (released 2014). What differs React from Vue and Angular is mainly the fact that React is a library and the other two are frameworks. Frameworks uses components to build the application, and includes tools for working with routing and data store. Since React is a library, solutions for routing and data store are not included, but has the use of components in common with Vue and Angular. 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
